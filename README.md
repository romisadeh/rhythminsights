 This project utilizes the Spotify API to extract data such as track information, user playlists, and user listening habits. It then processes this data to generate an [HTML file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/romisadeh/rhythminsights/blob/main/assets/spotifyApi.html) for visualizing trends, favorite tracks, and personalized recommendations. Perfect for exploring your Spotify data in a user-friendly format! <br />
